# JDBC Assignment
A simple JDBC project with a GUI to operate CRUD actions and export data as a .csv file using a MySQL database. 

This project was an assignment from my Data Architecture & Database Systems module during my Masters degree. I was tasked with analysing a telecommunications problem and creating sample relational data to describe this problem. My project observes the signal loss of a Wire Mesh Network over time as rain storm passes over Ireland. There are nodes set up in major Irish cities and these nodes are given basic location details and specific operating components.
