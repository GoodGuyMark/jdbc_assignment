# JDBC Assignment
A simple JDBC project with a GUI to operate CRUD actions and export data as a .csv file using a MySQL database. 

This project was an assignment from my Data Architecture & Database Systems module during my Masters degree. I was tasked with analysing a telecommunications problem and creating sample relational data to describe this problem. My project observes the signal loss of a Wire Mesh Network over time as rain storm passes over Ireland. There are nodes set up in major Irish cities and these nodes are given basic location details and specific operating components.

To install:
1. Download the code by cloning the repository or downloading the zip folder directly.
2. Create the database by running the database.sql file in a local MySQL server (You will need the MySQL Workbench to do this. You can download this here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
3. Import your project into a Java IDE (I use Eclipse but other IDEs should have no problem running this).
